# Image-Text-Reader
Extract texts from images (pngs/jpegs) and turn it into strings. Pretty fun.

Opencv and Tesseract need to be installed and imported.
With Opencv we will be able to read the image, and with Tesseract we pass the variable containing the image for the text to be extracted.
It is necessary to make sure that tesseract is present in your Windows Path. If not, you will have to install it. Download it from here:
https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

When it is installed, you will be able to pass the .exe location into a "path" varibale and properly use it.
